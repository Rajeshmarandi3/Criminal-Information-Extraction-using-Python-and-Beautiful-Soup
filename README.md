# Criminal-Information-Extraction-using-Python-and-Beautiful-Soup

This is one of the challenge I got while looking for a job opportunity from a company.
The website was http://cbi.nic.in/rnotice/notices.php.
I was a pure beginner though having some knowledge of beautiful.
I had never worked on information extraction from pdf or image.
I scrapped the pdf links, downloaded it and later processed and exctracted information using Python.
The image quality was not good for most of the pdfs thus I failed to extract clear information.
But this code will surely help you, if your pdf or image is in good state.
Good luck.
